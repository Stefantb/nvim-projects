INTRODUCTION                                    *projects*

Provide the concept of a project explicitly to Neovim. 

Let's have projects like we might be used to in other editor such as 
Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and so many others.

Let's keep the projects in a single directory outside of the source tree.

The projects plugin can be a provider of information for other plugins and
your own config. Like if you need to explicitly set the LSP root to a
directory that is not the repository root.

Sessions are great, lets use them, but lets have the project setting loaded
before sessions are loaded. That way the LSP's are set up right before buffers
are loaded.

Let's define a bunch of build tasks that are project specific and globally
applicable and lets easily switch between them.

Are you with me? Let's go.
